 
GEANT4 total pair-production cross-section estimates vs (E,Z)
These use the 18-parameter parametrization by L. Urban encoded in G4BetheHeitler.cpp
based on least-squares fits to the data of Hubbell, Gimm, Overbo (1980).
The range of validity is 1.5MeV < E < 100GeV and 1 <= Z <= 100
This may well be what is used in the CMS simulations (I need to check) 
 
The accuracy is estimated to be at worst 5% with a mean value of about 2.2% 
 
Radiation length constant calculated as      716.408
