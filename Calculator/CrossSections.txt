Initial estimates for cross-section ratio corrections come from 
analysis of one file of |eta| < 0.1 data with 2725 photons.
<E_gamma> = 0.7410 GeV.

For this case the mean cross-section ratios are:
Be: 0.8596      (assigned to BP)
C:  0.8681
F:  0.8895      (assigned to all other layers)
Si: 0.9099

These will likely change as more statistics are 
added (estimated stat. error is about 0.0005), the angular acceptance 
is changed, and the factors are calculated for the remaining photon flux 
incident on the radial super-layers.

It is also likely that the Z dependence of the determination may need to be 
a little more fine-grained. For example reflecting differences between 
BPIX layers and others.

Initial estimates for cross-section ratio corrections come from 
analysis of one file of |eta| < 0.7 data with 18629 photons. 
Estimated errors are around 0.00018. 
<E_gamma> = 0.8056 GeV

For this case the mean cross-section ratios are:
Be: 0.86557      (assigned to BP)
C:  0.87365
F:  0.89493      (assigned to all other layers)
Si: 0.91520

The increase in the cross-section ratio is because the energy is higher.

Initial estimates for cross-section ratio corrections come from 
analysis of one file of |eta| < 1.25 data with 33055 photons. 
Estimated errors are around 0.00014. 
<E_gamma> = 0.9508 GeV

For this case the mean cross-section ratios are:
Be: 0.87559      (assigned to BP)
C:  0.88299
F:  0.90395      (assigned to all other layers)
Si: 0.92400

The increase in the cross-section ratio is because the energy is higher.

Redo for |eta| < 0.7. Now calculate ppfraction and totratio.
