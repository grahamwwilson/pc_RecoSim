Initial estimates for cross-section ratio corrections come from 
analysis of one file of |eta| < 0.1 data with 2725 photons.

For this case the mean cross-section ratios are:

Be: 0.8596      (assigned to BP)
F:  0.8895      (assigned to all other layers)

These will likely change as more statistics are 
added (estimated stat. error is about 0.0005), the angular acceptance 
is changed, and the factors are calculated for the remaining photon flux 
incident on the radial super-layers.

It is also likely that the Z dependence of the determination may need to be 
a little more fine-grained. For example reflecting differences between 
BPIX layers and others.
